              Hello everyone! Welcome to my portfolio website. The name is Chien-Cheng Chiu, but you may address me as Jason. I graduated
              with a master's degree in Applied Mathematics in 2022, and one of my favourite part of my education was using
              different programming languages throughout my years of studies to compute numerical algorithms and/or plot graphs.
              It is one of the reasons why I decided to expand my horizon and learn to use new programming languages. I love origami as you can see
              as my header background image, but I also love racquet sports, espeically tennis. As the webpage shrinks in width, tennis balls become badminton
              shuttlecocks and then finally table tennis balls based on their direct proportionality in their different court sizes.
          </p> 
          <p class="paragraph">
              The mathematical programming language that I mainly used was MatLab; however, I have come across learning a bit of R,
              SQL, Python, Java and many other languages. Furthermore, I use a free resource tool known as LaTeX to write up my documents, and make 
              slides that also requires some knowledge in coding in a new language. These tools that I have used all seems very similar to 
              what I have learned so far except for CSS. Though CSS might be a little difficult for me to take in right now, I still have
              the patience to try to achieve the creative designs that I can always imagine in my head. In fact, this website design shows
              how much I like to research and learn new ways that I haven't been taught before.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
              During the only first three weeks of my certificate program in coding, I have touched about using Chrome Developer tools, and
              the neat one is the Lighthouse which analyze how well your website performs in performance, accessibility, best practices and
              SEO, which I had not yet covered during my studies. I learned to rescale my images such that webpage load more efficiently, which I have applied for this page. 
              This website is an example on my current expertise in coding and would display more on future projects.
